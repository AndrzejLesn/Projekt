<br>
<h4>Installation Instructions - Upgrade to a new version</h4>
<p>To upgrade your LuxCal calendar to a new version follow the Upgrade Instructions below.</p>
<br>
<h4>LuxCal 4.4.0 - Release date: 01.03.2016</h4>
<h5 class="redFlag">Important Notes for LuxCal 4.4:</h5>
<ol class="redFlag">
<li>Major Release: This LuxCal version is a major release with many changes, 
improvements and bug fixes. This version is using a MySQL database for the 
installed calendar(s). Before upgrading, please read the notes hereafter and read 
the change log, which can be viewed in the release notes on the LuxCal web site 
in the LuxCal Forum under What's New.</li>
<li>Database: Since this version has a number of new capabilities also the structure
 of the database will change. 
Before going any further be sure to back up your database (e.g. via the admin's 
Database page) and store the backup file in a safe place.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Upgrade Instructions</h5>
<p>If you are upgrading from an older version, carefully follow the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>IMPORTANT: Create a backup copy of your current calendar via the Database 
		page of the Administration drop-down menu in the navigation bar of the 
		calendar and backup your full calendar installation (the calendar root 
		folder and all sub-folders) to a temporary location.</li>
<li>a. When upgrading from a LuxCal version lower than 2.7.2, first upgrade to 
		LuxCal 2.7.2 (Ask the LuxCal team to send you a LuxCal 2.7.2 zip-file).<br>
		b. When upgrading from LuxCal version 2.7.2, make a backup copy of the file 
		<kbd>lcaldbc.dat</kbd> located in the calendar root on the server of your 
		hosting provider.<br>
		c. When upgrading from LuxCal version 2.7.3 or higher, make a backup copy of 
		the file <kbd>lcconfig.php</kbd> located in the calendar root on the server 
		of your hosting provider.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: If you have tailored the style sheet file, the language files or
		other files of your current calendar installation, make a backup of the 
		file(s) concerned and apply the changes to the new file(s) after successful 
		installation.</li>
<li>Delete all LuxCal files and folders from the server, <span class="redFlag">
		EXCEPT THE FILE <kbd>lcconfig.php</kbd> (or <kbd>lcaldbc.dat</kbd> - see 
		point 1. above) IN THE ROOT folder</span>.</li>
<li>Download and unzip the latest version of LuxCal (file: <kbd>luxcalxxx.zip</kbd>, 
		where 'xxx' is the version number). This file contains the following two 
		compresssed files: luxcalxxx-calendar.zip and luxcalxxx-toolbox.zip. Unzip 
		the file luxcalxxx-calendar.zip and upload all files and folders to the 
		calendar root on the server. Keep the file luxcalxxx-toolbox.zip for possible 
		later use.</li>
<li>Launch the calendar by browsing to the calendar root on the server. The 
		upgrade script will start automatically and if the upgrade is successful, 
		select Start Calendar.</li>
<li>If the calendar is displayed successfully, delete the following files from 
		the calendar root: <kbd>installxxx.php</kbd> and <kbd>upgradexxx.php</kbd> 
		(where 'xxx' is the calendar version number)</li>
<li>The file <kbd>lcconfig.php</kbd>, with the LuxCal version number and the 
		MySQL database credentials, in the calendar root on the server has been 
		created/changed. <span class="redFlag">Save a backup copy</span>.</li>
</ol>
			
<h5>Multiple Calendars</h5>
<p>This LuxCal version supports multiple calendars sharing the same database. 
These calendars are fully independent and have their own settings. The advantages 
are that the software is installed just once - so easy upgrading - and that you 
only need one database. For details see the <kbd>installation_guide.html</kbd> - 
section 4.</p>

<h5>Periodic Functions</h5>
<p>Note: If you want to use the calendar's periodic functions, like sending email 
reminders, exporting events in iCalendar format, etc., you need to set up a cron 
job which runs daily at approx. 2 AM and starts the <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd> script 
in the calendar's root folder. Details on how to define a cron job can be found 
in the header of the file <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd>.
Depending on the configuration settings, the <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd> script will 
execute the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>sending of email reminders</li>
<li>sending of emails with calendar changes *)</li>
<li>exporting events in iCalendar format *)</li>
<li>checking if events have expired and should be deleted *)</li>
<li>checking if user accounts have expired and should be deleted *)</li>
</ul>
<p>*) if activated on the admin's Settings page</p>

<h5>Language Files</h5>
<p>If you have translated one of the user interface language files into an other 
language, you should be aware of the following.</p>
<p>Each user-interface language is defined in three language files: ({lang} is 
the name of the language)</p>
<ul>
<li>lang/ug-{lang}.php file: User guide for the calendar users</li>
<li>lang/ui-{lang}.php file: User interface texts for the calendar pages</li>
<li>lang/ai-{lang}.php file: User interface texts for the admin pages</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For the language files character encoding "utf-8 without BOM" (BOM = Byte 
Order Mark) is recommended.</b></p>
<p>All language files included in the LuxCal download are up to date with this 
LuxCal version. However, for certain languages we could not translate the new 
and changed texts. These texts were added / changed in English and still need to 
be translated.</p>

<h5>Change Log</h5>
<p>The full change log can be viewed on the <a href="http://www.luxsoft.eu/" target="_blank"><b>
<i> LuxSoft web site</i></b></a> in the release notes in the LuxCal forum under 
"What's New". A detailed, more technical, list of changes can be found in the 
Developper's Notes in the file DevNotes-xx.txt in the calendar root folder.</p>
