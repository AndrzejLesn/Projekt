Change log - version 4.4:
========================

As of version 4.4.0
===================
01. install430.php: MySQL only: When during the calendar installation connecting 
    to the database fails, the error message to be displayed contained an 
    undefined variable.
02. dw_functions.php, css.php: The week and day view has been improved. If space 
    is available, events will take the full space. The styles have been changed 
    to make the events more sexy (css3 - more recent browsers).
03. month.php, week.php, day.php: The date(span) between the black back and 
    forward arrows is now a hyperlink to the next higher level, so: day -> week, 
    full week -> full month, work week -> work month and month -> year.
04. settings.php: Field validation of 'Remember me' cookie expiry days didn't 
    work properly.
05. settings.php, toolboxx.php, ai-{lang}.php, header.php: A new admin setting 
    has been added to enable/disable the display of View buttons next to the 
    options panel on the navigation bar. The view menu in the options panel can 
    now also be enabled / disabled on the Settings page. If all menus in the 
    options panel are disabled, the options panel button will not be displayed.
06. events.php: Send mail 0 (zero) days before event is now accepted and will 
    result in an email reminder on the event day. If the event is added/edited 
    on the event (start) date itself and 0 days is selected, an email will be 
    sent directly (same as "Send mail now").
07. notify.php: When sending email reminders, only email reminders up to 30 days 
    before the event date were processed, whilst up to 99 days can be specified 
    in the Event window.
08. toolboxx.php: On the admin's Settings page, saving calendar settings speeded 
    up by putting the database queries in a transaction.
09. toolboxx.php: Some redundant tests removed in init<table> functions and 
    saveSettings function.
10. many.php: Redundant stPrep, stExec and dbQuery tests removed. testing on 
    return value "false" already solved in try - catch construction.
11. lctools.php: SQLite only - The "Import" option doesn't work. No connection 
    to the database is made.
12. lcsbar.php, css_sbar.php: Redundant (unused) <div>-tag around hover box with 
    event details and corresponding style removed.
13. toolbox.js, checkevt.php, header.php, search.php, lcsbar.php, month.php, 
    year.php, dw_functions.php: The Check Event window, to check/uncheck "Todo" 
    events, has been made redundant. Event check boxes in front of the event 
    title can now be checked/unchecked directly by clicking the check box/check 
    mark, without reloading the page (using ajax).
14. toolbox.php: To prevent PHP notices, in the save last selections function, 
    first check if the PHP session has not expired.
15. settings.php: On the settings page under Events, posting of private events 
    was shown twice.
16. toolbox.php, css.php: Images displayed in the various views now have a 
    class='thNail' which limits the maximum width to the width of the day cell, 
    which results in a better display on small screens, like mobile devices.
17. css.php: Some style changes: absolute positioning nav bar removed and minor 
    padding changes to make maximum use of the "content" space.
18. ui-{lang}.php: In the Text Search Instructions on the Search page, the 
    explanation of the newly added user group was missing.
19. lcalcron.php: The MySQL version and the SQLite version of the lcalcron.php 
    file have been merged into one file. The difference are minor and the merge 
    makes maintenance easier.
20. settings.php, lcalcron.php, toolboxx.php, ai-{lang}.php: On the admin's 
    settings page, under periodic functions, it can now be specified whether the 
    cronjob is hosted locally (same server as the calendar), remote (external 
    server), or remote with a specified IP-address. Each time the cronjob runs, 
    even if it fails, technical details are logged in the log directory, which 
    facilitates fault finding when setting up a cron job.
21. groups.php: Duplicate HTML IDs and wrong label references solved in the edit 
    group form.
22. many.php, toolbox.js: A file upload feature has been added. If enabled in 
    the user group, users in this group can upload pdf, jpg, gif and png files 
    as attachment to an event. If added to the "event templates" on the admin's 
    Settings page, in the various views and emails the attached files will 
    appear as hyperlink, which allows the user to view the attachment in a new 
    window.
23. matrix.php, event.php, settings.php header.php, toolbox.js, ai-{lang}.php, 
    ui-{lang}.php, css.php: A new view, called matrix view has been added to the
